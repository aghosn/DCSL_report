\chapter{Implementation}
Redoing the memory management:
pages, pgroot, vmas, mms. New hierarchy, backward compatibility preserved though
all the code is available (hide mms behind a flag).

Sandbox is backported to dune.
Describe what the sandbox is and the different challenges I faced.

Now we have lwc as a library, inside a program ran inside the sandbox.

lwc implementation details, tricks, e.g., the mapping between host and guest,
translating the syscall arguments (i.e., the gvas to hvas)
